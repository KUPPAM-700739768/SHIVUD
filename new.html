	When I first saw you, I donno I will get this much attached to u. As the days went by I could feel slowly myself falling in love with you again and again. I think about you all the time from the time I wake up to the moment I fall asleep, You are the one who holds the key to my heart. If someone asks me now what is a beautiful life ? I would lean my head on to ur shoulder, hold u close to me and asnwer them saying this is it!! I am blessed to have you, the only wish I pray everyday is to marry you, have our home, have kids with u and grow old living a happy life together...Waiting for the day to say offically u are mine!!
